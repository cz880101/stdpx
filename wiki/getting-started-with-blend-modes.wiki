To apply a shader of the Stdpx library, you must use the `DisplayObject.blendShader` property of any display object.
All available blend modes are in the `stdpx.blendmodes.*` package. 

You have two ways to access a stdpx blend mode : _(examples below assume `myDisplayObject` is a `DisplayObject` instance)_

  * by creating an instance of a blend mode class : 

{{{
import stdpx.blendmodes.*;
// Applies a blend mode Saturation to myDisplayObject
myDisplayObject.blendShader = new BlendModeSaturation();
}}}

  * by accessing the blend mode through the `stdpx.blendmodes.StdpxBlendMode` or the `stdpx.blendmodes.FlashBlendMode` static classes.
The former wraps new blend modes that are not available natively in Flash Player and the latter wraps existing blend modes in Flash. The FlashBlendMode class exists only for compatibility.


|| StdpxBlendMode || FlashBlendMode ||
|| `stdpx.blendmodes.*` || `stdpx.blendmodes.*` ||
|| New blend modes not previously in flash || All legacy blend modes of Flash ||


{{{
import stdpx.blendmodes.StdpxBlendMode;
// Applies a blend mode Saturation to myDisplayObject
myDisplayObject.blendShader = StdpxBlendMode.SATURATION;
}}}

This way is more intuitive and faster to write, however you cannot specify parameters to the blend mode (not a bad news since there is no parameters for blend modes yet).

That's it for blend modes with Stdpx.
