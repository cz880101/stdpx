The STDPX library is gathered into a single SWC file. Each major upgrade of the library leads to a new SWC available in the downloads section.
To use the library in an Actionscript based project, you simply have to include this file to your project sources.

  * If you use an IDE, add the file in the project sources or library path. 
    * In Flex Builder, this is typically the default _libs_ directory. 
	* In Flash CS4, you can add the SWC or the folder containing the SWC with Library Path tab of the _File->Publish Settings->Flash->Settings_ menu.
  * If you use the command-line compilers, you may include the SWC file using one of the following commands :
    # -library-path
	# -include-libraries

You can also download the sources of the library and use them in your project. You may choose the sources from the _tags_ folder for a stable version, or use the trunk folder for the version in development.
